Transcripts of all chats (e.g., one-to-one conversations, virtual meeting rooms, and customer support conversations) will be retained by Salesforce for safety and security purposes. In using the Chat & Collaboration feature, you must follow the Salesforce Terms of Use (https://www.salesforce.com/company/legal/sfdc-website-terms-of-service/).

If you would prefer to not participate in one-to-one conversations, turn ‘Enable Chat’ off. If you choose to participate in one-to-one conversations, turn ‘Enable Chat’ on.  Your name, company name, and job title will appear in the event’s attendee directory that will be accessible to all attendees.

Your full name will appear in all chats (e.g., one-to-one conversations, virtual meeting rooms, and customer support conversations). If you’d prefer for only your first name to appear in one-to-one conversations, turn ‘Show Full Name’ off. Your full name will still appear in virtual meeting rooms and customer support conversations.
