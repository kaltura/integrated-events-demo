# Example Server & Client
This documentation provides detailed information about the Example Server & Client application, which demonstrates how to build an event page using Kaltura's API and components (C&C, player/KME). The application consists of a server implemented in Node.js with TypeScript using the Koa web framework, and a client-side webpage built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Introduction
The Example Server & Client application showcases how to integrate Kaltura event components into a web application. The server provides the necessary APIs for client-server communication, user management, and Kaltura integration. The client-side webpage initiates the CNC (Chat and Collaboration) app, retrieves partner data from the server, and enables user interactions.

## What the application does

Here's a general summary of how this application works:

- **Loading Libraries**: The application starts by loading the necessary libraries and dependencies. These may include frameworks like Koa, the Kaltura library, or any other components required for the application to function.

- **Setting Up Configuration**: Next, the application sets up its configuration. This involves defining variables, API keys, and any other settings specific to the application's environment.

- **Creating a Server**: The application creates a server instance using the Koa framework. The server listens for incoming requests from clients (web browsers, API clients, etc.) and routes those requests to the appropriate handlers.

- **Loading Content**: It loads static content such as HTML, CSS, and client-side JavaScript files. These files define the structure, styling, and behavior of the user interface.

- **Handling Requests**: When a request is received, the server determines the appropriate handler based on the requested URL and HTTP method. It may also parse request parameters, headers, and bodies to extract relevant data.

- **Processing Data**: The application may interact with a Kaltura API to retrieve or store data. It processes the data based on the request, performing tasks like making API calls, or performing business logic operations.

- **Generating Responses**: After processing the request and obtaining the necessary data, the application generates a response. This is HTML content.

- **Sending the Response**: The server sends the response back to the client that made the request. It includes the appropriate headers, such as status codes, content types, and any additional metadata.

- **Handling Errors**: Throughout the process, if any errors occur, the application handles them appropriately. This could involve logging the error, returning error messages to the client, or taking corrective actions to mitigate the issue.

- **Continuously Listening**: The server continues to listen for new requests, repeating the process for each incoming request until it is stopped or the application is shut down.

It's important to note that this is a high-level overview.

## Getting Started
To run the application, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository.
- Install the dependencies by running `npm install`.
- Configure the environment variables described in the "Configuration (.env environment variables)" section below.
- Start the server by running `npm run watch-server`.
- Open the client-side webpage in your browser.

## Configuration (.env environment variables)

The application requires certain configuration settings to connect with Kaltura and function properly. These settings are managed using environment variables. Create a .env file in the project's root directory and define the following environment variables:

- **KALTURA_PARTNER_ID=<Partner_id>** `-> PID found in the Kaltura Management Console (KMC)`
- **KALTURA_ADMIN_SECRET=<Admin_secret>** ` -> Admin Secret found in the KMC OR App Token (recommended)`
- **KALTURA_ADMIN_USER_ID=<User_id>** ` -> Owner of the KMC - found in the KMC`
- **KALTURA_URL=<Kaltura_url>** `e.g., https://www.kaltura.com`
- **KALTURA_UICONFID=<Player_id>** `-> Player ID taken from Studio in KMC`
- **KALTURA_CNC_UICONFID=<UI_conf_id>**` -> UIConf ID from the KMS admin's admin/config/tab/chatandcollaboration field "uiConfId"`
- **KALTURA_LEGALTEXT_ENTRY_ID=<Legal_id>** ` -> Entry ID that makes up the legal text URL, found in the KMS admin`
- **KALTURA_REACTION_UICONFID=<Reaction_id>** ` -> Reactions UIConf ID from the KMS admin's admin/config/tab/chatandcollaboration field "reactionsUiconfId"`
- **KALTURA_USE_GROUP_FOR_MODERATORS=<true/false>** ` -> toggle this to decide whether moderator should actually exist and be placed in groups or skip user group verification and just pass the group ID as if the user belongs to it`
- **KALTURA_KME_URL=<kme_url>** ` ->  Absolute URL where KME is launched from`
- **KALTURA_KME_SECRET=<lti_secret>** ` -> KME LTI launch secret`
- **KALTURA_KME_KEY=<lti_key>** ` -> KME LTI launch key`
- **KALTURA_KME_ROLE=<kme_role>** ` -> User role within KME room (Instructor/Student)`
- **METEDATA_PROFILE_ID=<metedat_profile_id>** ` -> The id of the profile id `
- **METEDATA_PROFILE_FIELD_ID=<metedat_profile_field_id>** ` -> The id of the profile field id`
- **METEDATA_FIELD_NAME=<metedat_field_name>** ` -> The name of the  Field `
- **ROOM_TEMPLATE_ID=<room_template_id>** ` -> The template id of the Room that was created for this partner `



Make sure to replace the placeholder values with the appropriate information for your Kaltura setup.

### Important note about the CnC authentication and authorization flow

The initial admin secret or app token (recommended) is primarily used to generate the JWT, and the JWT is used for authentication and authorization.

Make sure you have a custom metadata schema for entries configured in your KMC https://knowledge.kaltura.com/help/how-to-add-a-kaltura-custom-metadata-schema-profile
 
Here's a breakdown of the steps involved:

- **Initial Authentication**: The initial authentication is performed using an admin secret or an initial app token. This step is responsible for obtaining the necessary credentials to interact with the Kaltura API.

- **JWT Generation**: Once the initial authentication is successful, a JSON Web Token (JWT) is generated. The JWT is used for subsequent communication with the Kaltura Chat and Collaboration (CnC) server. It serves as an authentication token that verifies the identity of the client and allows access to the CnC services.

- **Retrieval of CnC App Token**: The `getAppToken()` function is responsible for retrieving the CnC app token. This token is specific to the CnC application and is required to access user information and interact with the CnC server. The `getAppToken()` function makes a request to the server to obtain the CnC app token, which is then used in the configuration of the Chat and Collaboration widget.

To summarize, the initial authentication provides the necessary credentials, the JWT is generated for authentication with the CnC server, and the `getAppToken()` function retrieves the CnC app token for accessing user information and configuring the CnC widget.


## Client-Side Application

The client side application is a single page that contains a form to which all necessary event details can be input:
- **user ID and all user details** (first name, last name, etc.)
- **entry ID** - the event "content" - this could be a VOD entry, a live entry (pre-recorded live included), a KME room.
- **virtual event ID** - an ID of a virtual event object created in Kaltura to encapsulate all analytics events under the specific event context.
- **Set As Moderator** checkbox - to indicate if the user should act as moderator in the chat.

### High Frontend Flow
- The webpage calls the server to retrieve static information such as partner ID and uiconf IDs (player and CnC) and uses these to load the relevant JS libraries from Kaltura.

- Once setting the details in the form and clicking the "init app" button, the webpage makes a call to the server passing the form information, expecting to get back:
  - a KS to be used for loading an authenticated player
  - a JWT to be used for loading an authenticated CnC widget 
  - KME room LTI launch parameters - **if the entry provided is a KME room entry**
  - the entry object, so metadata could be displayed on page if needed, and for client-side code to decide how to render the entry.

- The CNC app is loaded and displayed to the user, enabling real-time chat and collaboration features.
- a player is loaded in case the entry ID given is not a room entry, otherwise the room (KME) is launched.

## Server-Side Implementation
The Simple Node Typescript server is implemented using Node.js and the [Koa web framework](https://koajs.com/)). It provides the necessary APIs for the client-side webpage and handles user management and Kaltura integration.

Here are the important components of the server-side implementation:
- **routs.ts**: This file contains the API endpoints definitions and implementation (what you would usually see in a controller).
- **user.model.ts**: This file contains functions for verifying the user exists in Kaltura, and make sure it can act as moderator if requested.
- **cnc.model.ts**: This file is responsible for generating a JWT token for the CnC widget.

Also worth taking a look at:
- **kaltura-client-wrapper.ts** and see the reusable functions for getting a client object and go through the code into **generate-ks.ts** to see how a KS is generated locally without an API call to session.start (a performance consideration).
